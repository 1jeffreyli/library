# Library Project
## Description
The library app allows users to add and remove books that they’ve read. Users must provide the book’s title, author, number of pages, and whether or not they’ve read the book.

This web app was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, the layout was made using CSS Grid with a little Flexbox sprinkled in for text alignment.
### Challenges
- Tried to utilize an HTML table for the books but due to time constraints and JS difficulties, decided to just add the books as their own divs.
- Learned how to properly grab the input values from the form and manipulate them in JS using DOM methods. Specifically, I missed setting the action attribute to link to the file containing the JavaScript file.
- Future features could include dragging and dropping to reorder the books, add popping animations to the book on hover, and adding books inside of a table.
